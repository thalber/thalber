### Hello!

This wasp that does... Various stuff. So far mostly rain world mods, discord bots and misc utils.

I speak Russian, English, C#, and a little bit of Rust and F#. Modding made me more or less aware of .NET internals. If i'm lucky, i will expand this list gradually.

My longest standing project so far is [this thing](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/BOI). Possibly more complicated one is [this port of an old mod made by someone else](https://github.com/thalber/Remnant) (it is broken as of now :3)
